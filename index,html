            <h1>Inferno Dante</h1>
            <p>
                The Inferno is about the poet's journey into Hell. Guided by the poet Virgil, Dante descends through the Nine Circles of Hell, eventually arriving at the center where Satan himself resides. After escaping Hell, Dante and Virgil will go on to Purgatory and then Dante will go on to Heaven.

            <h2>9 Circles of Hell:</h2>
            <p><strong>Limbo:</strong> Inhabited by virtuous non-Christians and unbaptized pagans, who spend eternity in an inferior form of Heaven.</p>
            <p><strong>Lust:</strong> Punished by being violently blown back and forth by strong winds, symbolizing restlessness caused by lustful pleasures.</p>
            <p><strong>Gluttony:</strong> Souls lie in vile slush created by icy rain, symbolizing personal degradation through overindulgence.</p>
            <p><strong>Greed:</strong> Souls are divided into those who hoarded possessions and those who spent lavishly, endlessly jousting with heavy weights.</p>
            <p><strong>Wrath:</strong> The Fifth Circle holds the wrathful, who fight each other on the surface of the river Styx, and the sullen, who are submerged beneath it.</p>
            <p><strong>Heresy:</strong> Heretics are condemned to eternity in flaming tombs.</p>
            <p><strong>Violence:</strong> Divided into three rings, punishing murderers, suicides, and blasphemers with fitting torments.</p>
            <p><strong>Fraud:</strong> Divided into ten Bolgias, each punishing different types of deceitful sinners.</p>
            <p><strong>Treachery:</strong> The deepest circle, where betrayers are frozen in an icy lake, with the severity of their sin determining their depth.</p>
